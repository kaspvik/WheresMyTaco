# A WhereÂ´s My Taco? 
## A An interactive project to learn Javascript.

### About:

**In this project we would create an interactive experience using Javascript. The user must use buttons to get to different rooms to help the character Smulan, to find his taco.**

### Future ambitions with the project:
**Although the task was focused on javascript, the project contains html and css. I want to gradually continue with this project to gradually rewrite functions from HTML/Css to Javascript.**

### Bugs to be fixed: 

**From the start page, you can scroll down to other divas. In the future I want these to be invisible.**

**When the game ends and you choose to return to the start page, only the background image with strange margins is displayed. In the future, I want all features to appear on the home page.**
