# WhereÂ´s My Taco? 
## An interactive project to learn Javascript.

### About:

**In this project we would create an interactive experience using Javascript. The user must use buttons to get to different rooms to help the character Smulan, to find his taco.**

### Future ambitions with the project:
**Although the task was focused on javascript, the project contains alot of html and css. I want to continue with this project to gradually rewrite functions from HTML/Css to Javascript code.**

### Bugs and functions to be fixed: 
**From the start page, you can scroll down to other divs. In the future I want these functions to be fixed.**

**When the game ends and you choose to return to the start page, only the background image from the homepage with strange margins is displayed. In the future, I want all features to appear on the home page.**

**I want to make "The closet" locked until ypu find all the items in the other rooms**
